## About
I build high-impact software that turns complex data into clear decisions—from NASA ground-systems and video-game servers to Bloomberg’s real-time analytics. Over 15 years I’ve alternated between senior IC and engineering-manager roles, leading teams when the mission needs scale and diving hands-on when a frontier technology (most recently generative AI) demands invention.
* AI-driven analytics – architect of language-to-visualization and Text2BQL services that let Terminal users ask plain-English questions and receive charts or data at interactive rates.
* Data-visualization pedigree – shipped Bloomberg’s next-gen charting platform, the SHOK macro-stress tool, and offline rendering used by global news desks.
* Proven leadership – formed and guided multi-site teams, modernized legacy “big-iron” stacks to cloud-first, and mentored engineers who now lead core Bloomberg functions.

I thrive where deep systems work meets product urgency—bridging research and production to deliver tools that analysts, investors, and scientists rely on every day.
